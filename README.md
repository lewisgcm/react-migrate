# Simple React UI Library Example
This project aims to show how a UI component library could be constructed using React and Typescript for use within an existing multi-page site.
The general idea would be that pages/higher order components can be imported and used with plain old Javascript. As more of the multi-page site is moved into the components and pages then additional functionality could be added (such as routing) to migrate the multi-page site into a single page app. This project could be seen as a template for a multi-page site + Javascript to a React single page site migration strategy.

## Usage
There are commands, if using yarn then run the following:

```bash
yarn install
yarn test
yarn e2e # Runs a simple e2e test (against google)
yarn start # Run the simple application using webpack dev server 
```
